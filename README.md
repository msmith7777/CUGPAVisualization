Clemson University GPA Visualization

This is a personal project created to maintain my coding ability and focus on real-world applications. The program uses C to parse through a CSV containing grade distribution data for various classes
and extract useful information into a JSON file. That JSON file is then used by a front-end web interface to display data for specific courses based on user input.

This project is still in progress and mainly intended for personal learning and experimentation.
